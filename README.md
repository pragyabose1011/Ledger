# Ledger — AI-Native Meeting Intelligence Platform

Ledger is an **AI-native meeting intelligence platform** that converts unstructured meeting conversations into **structured, persistent, and actionable business outcomes**.

It captures meeting metadata and transcripts, applies **large language models (LLMs)** to extract **decisions and action items**, and stores them in a **scalable system of record** designed for productivity analytics, accountability, and workflow automation.

Ledger is architected as a **distributed, service-oriented system**, not a chatbot or UI-only application.

## Key Highlights 

* AI-powered information extraction using LLMs
* RESTful APIs built with FastAPI
* Modular backend architecture with service and worker layers
* SQL-based relational data modeling (SQLAlchemy ORM)
* Fault-tolerant AI integration with graceful degradation
* OpenAPI / Swagger-driven API documentation
* Designed for scalability, extensibility, and production hardening

---

## Problem Statement

Meetings generate critical business decisions and commitments, but these outcomes are often:

* undocumented
* scattered across tools
* difficult to track or audit

Ledger addresses this gap by acting as a **canonical intelligence layer** that reliably transforms conversational data into **structured, queryable artifacts**.

---

## System Capabilities

### 1. Data Ingestion Layer

* Meeting creation and participant management
* Transcript ingestion via REST APIs
* Decoupled capture mechanism (SDK-ready architecture)
* **Audio/Video Upload:** Upload recordings and auto-transcribe with OpenAI Whisper or local Whisper

### 2. AI Intelligence Layer

* LLM-driven extraction of:
  * decisions
  * action items
* Structured JSON output for downstream processing
* Provider-agnostic design (OpenAI + fallback engine)
* **Ask AI:** Query meeting history using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)

### 3. Persistence & Data Modeling

* Normalized relational schema
* Entities include:
  * meetings
  * participants
  * transcripts
  * decisions
  * action items
* Designed for traceability, accountability, and analytics

### 4. Reliability & Error Handling

* External AI treated as an unreliable dependency
* Call-time exception handling
* Automatic deterministic fallback logic
* No system-wide failures due to AI quota, auth, or network issues

## API Overview

### Meetings API

* `POST /meetings` — Create meetings with participant metadata

### Transcripts API

* `POST /transcripts` — Store raw meeting transcripts

### AI Extraction API

* `POST /extract` — Trigger AI-based extraction pipeline

### Audio Upload API

* `POST /upload/audio` — Upload audio/video files for transcription

### Integrations API

* `GET /integrations/zoom/recordings` — List Zoom cloud recordings
* `POST /integrations/zoom/import` — Import Zoom recording/transcript

Interactive documentation available via **Swagger UI**:

```
http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs
```

## Frontend Capabilities

* **Meetings Dashboard:** Create, view, and search meetings
* **Calendar View:** Visualize meetings by date
* **Meeting Detail:** View transcript, decisions, actions, risks, participants
* **Audio Upload:** Upload and transcribe recordings
* **Integrations Page:** Connect Zoom, Teams, Google Meet and import recordings
* **Ask AI:** Query meeting history with RAG
* **PDF Export:** Download meeting summaries
* **Email Notifications:** Automatic email summaries and action item assignments

---

## AI Processing Pipeline

1. Transcript fetched from relational database
2. Text passed to AI extraction service
3. LLM returns structured JSON:
   * decisions
   * action items
4. Results persisted transactionally
5. On AI failure:
   * fallback extraction used
   * API returns success
   * system state remains consistent

---

## Fault Tolerance Strategy

Ledger implements **defensive AI integration**:

* AI calls wrapped in exception handling
* Quota, authentication, and provider failures handled gracefully
* Deterministic fallback ensures:
  * system availability
  * demo reliability
  * production safety

This approach mirrors real-world **resilient distributed systems**.
